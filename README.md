# sqlite-sales-summary

This project demonstrates how to use Python and SQLite together to perform simple sales analysis.
We connect to a local SQLite database, query total quantities and revenues per product, and visualize the results using a bar chart with `matplotlib`.

### Tools Used

- Python 3
- SQLite3 (built-in to Python)
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

### Output

The script performs:
- SQL query to get total quantity sold and total revenue per product
- Prints the summarized result using `pandas`
- Plots a bar chart of revenue by product using `matplotlib`
